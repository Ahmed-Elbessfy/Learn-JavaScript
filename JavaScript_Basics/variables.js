// There is only 3 types of variables in javascript

let userNickname = "Swapnil"; // New type introduced in ES6. Value of let can change any time.

userNickname = "Swap76";

const PI = 3.14;// New type introduced in ES6. Value of pi now cannot be changed as this is defined as const.

var day26 = 26;// This is Deprecated as this creates many problems in future.



//Tips: *use significatives variables names, example: 
//	let a = "User's name" for let userNickName = "User's name"
//*CammelCase for a better understaning, JS has case sensitive.
//*Variables names must begin with a letter.
//*write constants with Upper case.
