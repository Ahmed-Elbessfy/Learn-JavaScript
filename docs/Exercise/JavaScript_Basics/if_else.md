### Look up how to get the current time in Javascript. Based on this, create a series of if-else statements that will check against the current time and print either: 

- "Good morning!" if it's from 6:00am-12:00pm
- "Good afternoon!" if the time is between 12:00pm - 6:00pm
- "Good evening!" if the time is from 6:00pm to Midnight 
- "Good night!" if the time is from Midnight to 6:00am.
