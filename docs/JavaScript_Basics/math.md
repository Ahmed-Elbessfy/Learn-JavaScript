# JavaScript Math Functions

* Math is a global, static Javascript object 
* They are used on the `Number` type
* I will discuss the following Javascript Math operators, `Math.round()`, `Math.power()`, `Math.sqrt()`, `Math.abs()`.

## 1. Math.round()
* This function rounds a number to the nearest round number
* or as described by the documentation: 
> _Returns the nearest single precision float representation of a number._

## 2. Math.pow()
* This calculates the power of a number for you, you remeber that from math class right? The small number floating above the number to be powered.
* or as described by the documentation: 
> _Returns base to the exponent power,that is:_ 
> base<sup>exponent</sup>

## 3. Math.sqrt()
* This function calculates the square root of a number
* or as described by the documentation: 
> _Returns the positive square root of a number._

## 4. Math.abs()
* Returns the absolute value of a number.
